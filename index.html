  <!-- ABOUT -->
  <section>
    <h3>About Me</h3>
    <p>
      I’m someone who notices gaps and builds bridges.  
      At Zoho, I didn’t just work within teams — I created one.
      <br><br>
      As a footballer, I’ve seen how shared goals turn strangers into teammates.
      That belief led me to initiate and organize a company-wide football tournament
      involving 100+ teams to improve cross-team collaboration and morale.
      <br><br>
      I specialize in Zoho applications, automation workflows, and technical support,
      with a strong bias toward ownership and execution.
